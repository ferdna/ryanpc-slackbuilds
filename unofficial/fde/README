All your favorite dev tools and more

Firefox Developer Edition brings your core dev tools together 
with some powerful new ones that will extend your ability to 
work across multiple platforms from one place. 
It’s everything you’re used to, only better. And only from Firefox.

Since the executable is still called 'firefox', it is symlinked to /usr/bin/ as 'fde'.
