Atom is a Chrome-based text editor, hackable and full-featured.

Atom comes loaded with the features you've come to expect from
a modern text editor, like a file system browser, fuzzy finder for
quickly opening files, fast project-wide search and replace,
snippets, code folding and more.

To build Atom, about 500MB of data must be downloaded,
stored in ~/.atom. It can be deleted after building.

Optional building features:
* Disable metrics module for Google Analytics
  (https://github.com/atom/metrics)

    DISABLE_METRICS=yes|no (default: no)

* Delete temporary data cached after building package

    DELETE_CACHE=yes|no (default: no)
